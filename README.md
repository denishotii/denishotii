# 👋 Hey, I'm Denis

I’m a **Software Developer** and **Data Science student** passionate about turning ideas into real, working products.  
Currently, I’m working at **XITASO GmbH** in the **Healthcare AI** sector — building intelligent tools that make hospital processes smarter and more efficient.

💡 Outside of work and uni (Data Science @ KU Eichstätt-Ingolstadt), you’ll often find me:
- ⚙️ Exploring new technologies in **AI, Machine Learning, and Web Development**
- 🚀 Joining hackathons across Europe — from healthcare to civic tech
- 🏀 Playing basketball or ✈️ discovering new cities

I love solving real-world problems with code — from predictive models to chatbots and automation tools.  
If you’re working on something exciting in AI, data, or digital innovation — let’s connect!
